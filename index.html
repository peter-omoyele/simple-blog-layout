        <h1>Follow Your Heart 💚</h1>

        <h2>To learn to code or not?</h2>

        <p>If it’s been on your mind to learn how to code, but you’re not quite sure about it, I hope this piece helps you make a decision. I hope it’s all the closure you need.</p>

        <p>And if you already took the leap, I hope this piece strengthens your resolve. Either way, I’m rooting for you.</p>

        <p>By the way, who else thinks this (🧏🏿) is a smiley for Watimagbo? 😂</p>

        <h2>I think I should pick up coding 🤔</h2>

        <p>That’s a thought that plagued my mind almost all the time. Not all the time, of course. But there are moments. You know how the Bible speaks of a friend that sticks closer than a brother. Those thoughts nagged me more than an angry wife ever could.</p>

        <p>If you’re reading this, my bet is that you have those moments, too. If you’re a self-aware, forward-thinking person who is alive to the dizzying levels of change the planet has undergone and is undergoing, chances are you’ve thought of picking up a new skill.</p>

        <p>And not just a new skill, but one that is both valuable and in high demand. For most people, it’s coding.</p>

        <p>Here’s my counsel: if it’s been on your mind to learn to code, you probably should learn it.</p>

        <p>“Nah! I have a skill that makes me money at the moment,” you might argue. But I think that following the natural curiosities of your heart is a much stronger foundation upon which to build a career than following what makes you money at the moment.</p>

        <p>It really doesn’t matter what you do now. If “Should I learn to code?” has been a question on your mind, you should try to answer the question. Pick it up.</p>

        <p>If you then find that you can’t crack the code, you can always drop it. You’ll know you tried. In my case, I’ve dropped it once, and now I’m back at it. See?</p>

        <h2>A quick digression to help your doubting mind 🤔</h2>

        <p>Your ability to learn isn’t fixed. It’ll grow if you water it. There’s is no limit to your abilities and new things you can learn.</p>

        <p>You can change anything about yourself if you put your mind to it and leverage the right support.</p>

        <p>If you can’t code, it just means you haven’t learned how to YET. With enough effort and the right support, you’ll find that you CAN.</p>

        <h2>But If you don’t plan to be the best programmer there ever was, you might as well quit now. 🤷</h2>

        <p>It’s great that you’re now convinced you should start coding. But if you’re not going to put in the effort to be the best, why bother to start? 😏</p>

        <p>Remember our quick digression? 👆 There’s is no limit to your abilities and new things you can learn. In other words, you are capable of being the best programmer in the world.</p>

        <p>So, why settle for less than you’re capable of. Why settle for good enough when you can be the best in the world? 🌚</p>

        <p>By the way, there goes your WHY. Remember how Simon Sinek all says to START WITH WHY. Well, I just gave you yours. You’re welcome. I’m glad you love it.</p>

        <p>To understand why I think it’s important that you prepare to put in the effort to be the best, read THE DIP by Seth Godin.</p>

        <h2>You’ve got this! 😎</h2>

        <p>Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of Eat, Pray, Love, once said every major spiritual epic journey in our lives begin in a moment of self-interviewing.</p>

        <p>They begin in moments you ask yourself life’s big questions. Who am I? What do I want? Why am I so unhappy? How can I change this? What do I want to do with my one, wild, and wonderful life?</p>

        <p>Those answers won’t always come to you in a flash. They might take days, weeks, months, even years. But when they come to you, don’t let anything get in the way.</p>

        <p>If you could do anything, don’t limit it. Blow it up as big as you can imagine it to be. If you wanna learn to code, prepare the to be best.</p>

        <p>I’ll leave you with a quote by Randall E. Stross.</p>

        <blockquote>The best programmers are not marginally better than only good programmers. They’re an order of magnitude better at everything: creativity, speed, ingenuity, and problem-solving skills.</blockquote>

        <p>I'll talk to you soon. ✌</p>
